# Oscar-Award-Exploration

Our exploratory data analysis project focused on identifying trends and patterns of winning categories in Oscar-nominated films over the past 96 years. We found that 5,042 movies were nominated across 115 categories, with 1,329 films emerging as winners. 'Directing' had the highest number of nominations, while 'short films' and 'documentaries' had the highest winning proportions. The most award-winning movies were 'Titanic,' 'West Side Story,' 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,' and 'Ben-Hur.' Alfonso Cuar√≥n emerged as the most award-winning individual. The 1940s was the most award-winning decade, with 170 distinct films clinching awards.
